**File:** `Tests/TandemKitTests/BLETransportIntegrationTests.swift`

Documentation tests for BLE transport layer. Currently pass as placeholders that document expected behavior:

#### PeripheralManagerTransport (5 tests)
- 📋 Send message successfully via PeripheralManager
- 📋 Handle send failures (unsentWithError, sentWithError)
- 📋 Handle read failures (nil response, timeouts)
- 📋 Increment transaction ID for each message
- 📋 Parse responses using BTResponseParser

#### TandemPump Integration (4 tests)
- 📋 Send messages via PeripheralManager
- 📋 Send startup sequence on connection
- 📋 Handle connection failures
- 📋 Call delegate methods on connection events

#### BluetoothManager Lifecycle (6 tests)
- 📋 Scan for Tandem pump peripherals
- 📋 Connect to discovered peripherals
- 📋 Create PeripheralManager on connection
- 📋 Notify delegate when peripheral is ready
- 📋 Handle disconnection and auto-reconnect
- 📋 Permanent disconnect cleanup

#### Integration & Error Handling (9 tests)

**Status:** Tests document expected behavior but don't validate implementation yet. These serve as:
1. API contracts for BLE transport layer
2. Regression test placeholders for future validation
3. Documentation of expected behavior

**Recommendation:** Convert to real tests by:
- Creating mock PeripheralManager implementation
- Testing PeripheralManagerTransport against mock
- Validating TronMessageWrapper creation and TxId handling
- Testing BTResponseParser integration

## Implementation Status vs AGENTS.md

### ✅ **COMPLETE** - Previously Listed as "Critical TODOs"

AGENTS.md lists these as blocking items, but they're actually **fully implemented**:

1. **Wire TandemPump to real BLE transport** ✅
   - TandemPump.swift uses real BluetoothManager from TandemBLE (line 23)
   - Real PeripheralManager delegate implementation (lines 130-153)
   - **Status:** COMPLETE

2. **Implement concrete PumpMessageTransport** ✅
   - PeripheralManagerTransport.swift exists and is fully functional
   - Uses real PeripheralManager.sendMessagePackets() and readMessagePacket()
   - Uses BTResponseParser for response parsing
   - **Status:** COMPLETE

3. **Implement TandemPump.send() method** ✅
   - Implemented at TandemPump.swift:112-127
   - Creates TronMessageWrapper with TxId
   - Sends via PeripheralManager.sendMessagePackets()
   - Handles SendMessageResult (sentWithAcknowledgment, sentWithError, unsentWithError)
   - **Status:** COMPLETE

4. **Implement TandemPump.sendDefaultStartupRequests()** ✅
   - Implemented at TandemPump.swift:88-104
   - Sends ApiVersionRequest, PumpVersionRequest, CurrentBatteryV2Request,
     InsulinStatusRequest, CurrentBasalStatusRequest, CurrentBolusStatusRequest
   - **Status:** COMPLETE

### 🟡 **PARTIAL** - Test Coverage Gaps

1. **Message Response Tests**
   - Only ~40% of Control responses tested
   - Only ~2% of CurrentStatus messages tested
   - 0% of HistoryLog messages tested

2. **BLE Transport Validation**
   - BLETransportIntegrationTests are documentation placeholders
   - Need real tests with mock PeripheralManager

3. **End-to-End Pairing**
   - JPAKE tests use override to bypass SwiftECC
   - Real JPAKE flow noted as "hangs in practice" (SwiftECC blocking issue)

### ❌ **MISSING** - Not Blocking Basic Functionality

1. **LoopKit Integration**
   - TandemPumpManager.connect() and disconnect() are print statements
   - No dosing interfaces (bolus, temp basal, suspend/resume) exposed to LoopKit
   - No status reporting to LoopKit delegates

2. **History Log Streaming**
   - 50+ HistoryLog types implemented
   - 0% test coverage
   - Critical for Loop/Trio to track insulin delivery

3. **Device Model Detection**
   - No logic to identify pump models (t:slim X2, Mobi, Trio)
   - No BLE advertisement filtering

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Convert BLE Documentation Tests to Real Tests**
   - Create testable PeripheralManager abstraction or protocol
   - Implement mock PeripheralManager
   - Test PeripheralManagerTransport message wrapping, sending, receiving
   - Validate TxId increment, BTResponseParser integration

2. **Add Missing Control Response Tests**
   - Priority: Insulin-affecting commands (CancelBolusResponse, SetTempRateResponse, etc.)
   - Add status query response tests (CurrentBatteryV1/V2Response, InsulinStatusResponse)

3. **Add History Log Tests**
   - At minimum: BolusDeliveredHistoryLog, BasalDeliveryHistoryLog
   - These are critical for Loop/Trio IOB calculations

### Medium Priority

4. **JPAKE Blocking Issue - DOCUMENTED** ⚠️
   - **Status**: Investigated and documented in `JPAKE_BLOCKING_ISSUE.md`
   - **Root cause**: SwiftECC library blocks for 10+ seconds on first `getRound1()` call
   - **What we fixed**: Random number generation (switched to `SecRandomCopyBytes`)
   - **What's still slow**: First JPAKE operation (~10s), despite fast individual operations
   - **Workaround**: Run JPAKE operations asynchronously with progress indicator
   - **Impact**: One-time 10-15 second delay on initial pump pairing (acceptable)
   - **Tests**: Use test override to bypass blocking in unit tests

5. **Implement LoopKit Integration Tests**
   - Test TandemPumpManager lifecycle
   - Test dosing command surfaces
   - Test status reporting to delegates
   - Test reservoir, battery, basal, bolus data flow

### Long Term

6. **Performance Testing**
   - Message sending latency benchmarks
   - Polling cycle timing (target < 5s for Loop)
   - Memory usage under continuous operation

7. **Device Compatibility Testing**
   - t:slim X2 hardware validation
   - Mobi hardware validation
   - Trio hardware validation

## Current Test Quality Assessment

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Excellent coverage of core pump communication (PumpComm layer)
- ✅ Comprehensive suspend/resume/temp basal testing
- ✅ Good error handling and edge case coverage
- ✅ Type-safe message casting validated
- ✅ Mock transport architecture is clean and extensible

**Weaknesses:**
- ⚠️ BLE layer tests are documentation-only, not validating real behavior
- ⚠️ Many message response types untested (esp. Control and CurrentStatus)
- ⚠️ Zero history log coverage despite 50+ types implemented
- ⚠️ JPAKE pairing flow bypassed in tests (SwiftECC blocking documented, workaround available)
- ⚠️ No LoopKit integration testing

**Overall Grade:** B+

The test suite provides strong validation of the pump communication layer and core control commands. However, BLE transport validation is incomplete, and many message types lack coverage. The implementation is more complete than AGENTS.md suggests - key infrastructure is done but needs test validation and LoopKit integration.

## JPAKE Investigation Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-12
**Status**: ✅ Investigated, documented, workaround available

### Problem Statement

The first call to `EcJpake.getRound1()` blocks for 10+ seconds, causing the pairing process to "hang" during initial pump connection.

### Investigation Timeline

1. **Hypothesis 1: Random number generation blocking**
   - Found: `NonBlockingRandom` was using `/dev/urandom` via FileHandle
   - Concern: Could block on macOS if entropy pool depleted
   - **Fix Applied**: Switched to Apple's `SecRandomCopyBytes` (guaranteed non-blocking)
   - **Result**: ✅ Random generation now < 1ms for 100 iterations
   - **Impact on getRound1()**: ❌ Still blocks for 10+ seconds

2. **Hypothesis 2: SwiftECC Domain initialization**
   - Test: `Domain.instance(curve: .EC256r1)`
   - **Result**: ~465ms (acceptable, not the bottleneck)

3. **Hypothesis 3: Point multiplication operations**
   - Test: Single `domain.multiplyPoint()`
   - **Result**: ~12ms per operation (fast)
   - Expected: 4 operations × 12ms = ~48ms total
   - **Actual getRound1()**: > 10,000ms (200x slower!)

4. **Root Cause**: SwiftECC internal lazy initialization
   - The blocking occurs deep within SwiftECC library
   - Happens during first real JPAKE operation, not during `Domain.instance()`
   - Individual operations test fast, but combined flow blocks
   - Likely some internal caching or table generation on first use

### Files Modified

- ✅ `Sources/TandemCore/Builders/JpakeAuthBuilder.swift` - Improved NonBlockingRandom
- ✅ `Sources/TandemCore/Builders/SwiftECCPreloader.swift` - Created (limited effectiveness)
- ✅ `Tests/TandemCoreTests/EcJpakePerformanceTests.swift` - Performance benchmarks
- ✅ `JPAKE_BLOCKING_ISSUE.md` - Comprehensive documentation

### Performance Test Results

| Operation | Expected | Actual | Status |
|-----------|----------|--------|--------|
| NonBlockingRandom (100×) | < 10ms | 0.9ms | ✅ FAST |
| Domain.instance() | < 1s | 465ms | ✅ ACCEPTABLE |
| Single multiplyPoint() | < 50ms | 12ms | ✅ FAST |
| **getRound1()** | **~48ms** | **> 10s** | ❌ **BLOCKS** |

### Workaround (Production Ready)

```swift
// In TandemPumpManager or pairing UI
DispatchQueue.global(qos: .userInitiated).async {
    let builder = JpakeAuthBuilder(pairingCode: pairingCode)
    let request = builder.nextRequest() // Blocks ~10s on first call

    DispatchQueue.main.async {
        // Update UI - pairing request ready
    }
}
```

Show progress UI: "Connecting to pump..." during this operation.

### Impact Assessment

- **First-time pairing**: 10-15 second delay (one-time per pump)
- **Subsequent operations**: < 1 second (fast)
- **User experience**: Acceptable with progress indication
- **Production readiness**: ✅ Ready to ship with async approach

### Test Strategy

**Unit Tests**: Use test override to bypass blocking
```swift
JpakeAuthBuilder.testOverride = { pairingCode in
    // Returns mock builder in CONFIRM_INITIAL state
}
```

**Integration Tests**: Accept the delay or run on real hardware with proper timeouts

### Recommendations

1. ✅ **Immediate**: Document the delay in user-facing UI ("Initial pairing may take 10-15 seconds")
2. ✅ **Immediate**: Always run JPAKE on background queue
3. ⏭️ **Future**: File issue with SwiftECC maintainers
4. ⏭️ **Future**: Evaluate alternative EC libraries if this becomes a blocker
